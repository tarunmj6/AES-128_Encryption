This folder contains 3 programs for the three parts mentioned in the question. 
For each of the programs, it is run as follows:
1. Open two command prompts (Windows, I am using this):
2. Set the path using the cd command.
3. There are two files ServerSide.java and ClientSide.java in each folder.
4. Compile by typing "javac ServerSide.java" in one command prompt and "javac ClientSide.java" in the other.
5. After compiling both, type "java ServerSide" in one cmd and then "java ClientSide" in the other. Press Enter and the program
runs and gives the output.
6. For Question-1 and Question-2, the output is written to files which will appear in the corresponding folders.
7. For Question-3, output appears in the cmd itself.
